      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Wetlands are natureâ€™s hidden treasure, storing vast amounts of carbon, protecting against floods, and supporting diverse ecosystems. However, they face growing threats from human activities and climate change.
We founded Earthway Alliance to address these challenges head-on. Through collaboration with local communities, we restore degraded wetlands and equip people with the skills to conserve these vital ecosystems for generations to come.</p>

      <p>From tree planting drives to wetland restoration initiatives, we are proud to have positively impacted biodiversity and livelihoods. Our journey has been filled with learning, collaboration, and a growing passion for making a difference.</p>

      <h3>Our Impact in Action and Testimonials</h3>
      <p>Restoring Wetlands, Transforming Lives
In Baringo and Uasin Gishu counties, Earthway Alliance has empowered communities to restore degraded wetlands,
improving access to clean water and boosting biodiversity. 
"Earthway Alliance helped our community restore the wetlands, creating a safer and cleaner water source for our village," shared a community elder. This initiative is a testament to the power of collaboration in building climate-resilient communities.

      <p>Our reforestation campaigns have involved planting thousands of trees with the help of volunteers, community members, and students. 
        We have also focused on training communities to adopt climate-resilient agricultural practices and restore wetland ecosystems critical for sustaining biodiversity.</p>
